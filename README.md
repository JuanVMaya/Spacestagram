# Spacestagram: Image-sharing from the final frontier
# By: Juan Jose Vanegas Maya 

This project was created from scratch with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Shopify Challenge

In the project you can:

### `Fetch data from one of NASA’s APIs and display the resulting images `
Search results should come from NASA’s free APIs.
### `Display descriptive data for each image `
Each image result lists at least a title, date of capture (ideally in earth_date) and a button to “like” that image. Or, for example: title, date, description, etc. 
### `Each image can be “liked”, and a user should be able to undo their “like”`
